                        Tiny GNU Privacy Guard
                      ==========================
                            Version 0.0.0


This is an OpenPGP implementation targeted to small devices and comes
with a couple of restrictions.  It does not feature a key management
but relies on gpg to provide a useful set of keys.  A syncronisation
mechanism to achieve this is implemented.  The API is similar to
GPGME.



Requirements:

  sizeof (char) == 8
  sizeof (int) >= 16
  sizeof (long) >= 32
  flat and linear address space
  C-89 toolchain
